# Drones and UAVS Management 
Management of traffic on ground has been a major area of consideration that too when there is just one level of traffic. Now with increase in popularity of UAVs and drones, we will be faced with the challenges of managing a multi level traffic, monitoring safe routes to prevent aerial trespassing, detecting & preventing mid air collisions and thus limiting the exposure for the citizens.

Our project focuses on effective design, engineering and delivery of solution for detecting & managing UAVs & Drones and setting up geo fences using predictive analytics and blockchain. Monitoring Air traffic to ensure security, privacy of citizens.

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.    

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.  

A more safe & regulated local air traffic of drones & UAVs with availability of movement data and prediction of future of conditions. Drone incident reporting, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application.
